title: EventStore
---

The EventStore it self in Sequent is encapsulated by the `Sequent::Core::EventStore`.
Users of Sequent normally do not interface with the EventStore directly. The [AggregateRepository](aggregate-repository.html)
handles access to the EventStore.
When you want to gather statistics on the EventStore you will most likely query the one of the [tables](#tables-in-the-eventstore) directly or via de
ActiveRecord class: `Sequent::Core::EventRecord` or the one you specified in your Sequent configuration by
overriding `event_record_class`

## Tables in the EventStore

The initial EventStore in Sequent consists of a postgres schema containing three tables:

- [event_records](#event_records)
- [command_records](#command_records)
- [stream_records](#stream_records)


## event_records

The `event_records` table contains all [Events](event.html) that are applied in sequent. It consists of the following columns:

|column name        | Description
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
`aggregate_id`      | The id of the [AggregateRoot](aggregate-root.html) on which this Event applies
`sequence_number`   | The sequence number determines the order in which the events occurred
`created_at`        | The datetime this event was constructed
`event_type`        | The `class` name of the Event
`event_json`        | The Event serialized as json
`command_record_id` | The id of the `command_record` that "caused" this event
`stream_record`     | The id of the `stream_record` to which this Event belongs

## command_records

The `command_records` table contains all [Commands](command.html) that are succesfully executed in Sequent.

|column name            | Description
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
`aggregate_id`          | The id of the Aggregate on which this command applies. This is optional since a command can also spawn multiple aggregates.
`user_id`               | The id of the user that executed this command. This is also optional. If your command has a `user_id` attribute this will be set.
`command_type`          | The `class` name of the Command
`command_json`          | The Command serialized as json
`event_aggregate_id`    | The aggregate id of the `event_record` that "caused" this command. This is optional and is filled when a command is executed as a side effect of an event (Through workflows for instance)
`event_sequence_number` | The sequence number of the `event_record` that "caused" this command. This is optional and is filled when a command is executed as a side effect of an event (Through workflows for instance)
`created_at`            | The datetime this Command was constructed

## stream_records

The `stream_records` table contains all AggregateRoots in the Sequent EventStore in order to support [Snapshotting](snapshotting.html)
This table is used internally in Sequent. When you use Sequent in your project you do not need to interface with this table.

|column name        | Description
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
`created_at`        | The datetime this StreamRecord was constructed
`aggregate_id`      | The id of the AggregateRoot
`aggregate_type`    | The `class` name of the AggregateRoot
`snapshot_threshold`| The number of Events on an AggregateRoot as threshold for when to take a snapshot
